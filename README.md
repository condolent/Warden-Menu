[AlliedModders](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=298907)

## Description
This plugin works great for jailbreak servers on CS:GO where the current warden can open up a menu. This menu gives the warden access to round-specific commands/variables that create funny games for all the players!

## Installation
Download and drop all the contents in /addons/sourcemod/ into your /csgo/addons/sourcemod/ folder.  
Type `sm plugins load cmenu` in the server console and you're done!

## Dependencies
This plugin currently only works with [ESK0s Jailbreak Warden](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=278136) plugin.  
Make a request and I'll implement other warden plugins aswell.  
If you have `sm_cmenu_doors` set to `1` then you will also need [Smart Jail Doors](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=2306018#post2306018).

## Features
The major function this plugin offers is that the warden can choose a special day to play out for the round. Each day has some special server rules that applies in order to make it much more fun for the players!  
1. Hide and Seek
2. Freeday
3. Warday
4. Gravity Freeday

There's also some other functions in the menu that the warden can take advantage of in order to make the game more comfortable.  
Some of the other entries in the menu include:  
1. Toggle noblock
2. Weapons menu, allowing the warden to spawn in the selected weapon to himself
3. Give a specific player(s) freeday, marked with beacons
